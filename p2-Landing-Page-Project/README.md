# Landing Page Project
Udacity Front End Web Developer - JavaScript & The DOM : Project Landing page

## Project Summary
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

## Start
The project can be run by opening the index.html file in the browser.

## Content
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
