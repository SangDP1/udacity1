					<h2>Chapter 1 - THE BABY WHO LIVED</h2>
					<p>
						Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that
						they were perfectly normal, thank you
						very much. You could not expect them to believe in anything strange or
						mysterious, for they simply did not
						bother with such nonsense.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.
						He was a tall, muscular man, with
						hardly any neck, but a large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and fair,
						with a neck twice as long as the average...

					<h2>Chapter 2 - THE VANISHING GLASS</h2>
					<p>

						Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken to find their
						grandson on the doorstep, but Privet
						Drive had not changed a bit. The sun still rose and illuminated the brass
						number four on the Dursleys' door.
						The sunlight streamed into the living room, much as it had when Mr.
						Dursley had sat watching the fateful
						news report about the owls. Only the photographs hanging by the fireplace
						had changed over the years. Ten
						years ago there had been countless pictures on the walls of a baby who
						looked like a pink beach ball,
						wearing bows of every color...

					<h2>Chapter 3 - THE LETTERS OF NO ORIGIN</h2>
					<p>
						The escape of the Brazilian Boa Constrictor resulted in Harry's longest
						detention yet. By the time Harry was
						allowed out under the stairs, the summer holidays had begun and Dudley had
						smashed his new video camera, smashed
						his remote-controlled plane, and knocked Mrs Figg off her feet as she
						tried to cross the road on her first bike
						ride.
					</p>
					<p>
						Harry was glad that the school year was over, but he couldn't escape
						Dudley's gang, who came to visit every day.
						Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and small-minded, but
						Dudley was the biggest and dumbest of the
						bunch, and was their leader. They all enjoyed taking part in Dudley's
						favourite sport, hunting Harry Potter.

						Boom! The person outside was banging on the door again. Dudley was woken.
						He asked, bewildered:

						- Where did the cannons go off?

						Behind them, the door creaked, and Mr. Dursley came out, gun in hand - Ah,
						so that long package you saw him
						carrying to the island was this gun.

						He shouted:

						- Who's there? I warn you, I have a gun.

						There was silence. Then...
						RRRR...BANG...
